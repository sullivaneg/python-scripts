## Objective

This script is my first time playing around with scraping
web pages using Python. The goal for this script
is to scrape the html from the URL for my youtube
watchlist and take the number of videos on my watchlist
and add that, the time, and the date to a excel file or 
some data structure that can be exported as a excel file
using PANDAS. I'm going to play around with cron jobs in
my mac terminal to set this script to auto run.
